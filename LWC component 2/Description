Amdocs is a Product based company. They want functionality that allows them to change
the ownership of multiple records from different objects without updating each record
individually.
For this, you have to create an LWC component that includes a data table and objects
picklist. Based on object selection you need to show records in the data table. The data
table will display the last 20 records created. There will be two-row action buttons i.e
View and Delete. On click of View, the user should be redirected to the record detail
page.
There is one more data table to show the list of users. There will be an assign button for
each user record row. The user should be able to select multiple records from the record
table and can assign them to any of the users from the user table using the assign
button.
Similar to multiple record selection, a user can select multiple users as well from the
Users table and then in the object record data table only those records will be shown
which are owned by select users. For example, if we select User1 in the user table only
those leads/cases will be shown that are owned by User1. It will also work if we select
multiple users in the user table.
Note: Objects available in the picklist should be Account, Contact, Lead, Opportunity, and
Case. The data table should have the following columns:
Name (ex. Case Number for Case), and the Owner field as columns
