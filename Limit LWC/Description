Advice Alliance is a Consultation Firm and they are using Salesforce and have a
lot of users and custom objects in it, now they want a dashboard that will reflect
the Salesforce Org Object Limit, User Licenses and Org Limit(like API callout etc.).
For this, you need to create a dashboard component with 3 tabs, one will show
the limits for Object Fields like Reference, Roll Up, Formula, Lookups, Master-detail
and second will show User licenses count and usage and another will show the
Salesforce org limit.
In the dashboard, we have to show the total number of available and currently
used entities and the total number of entities we can create in salesforce. For
example, on Account object we can have utmost 500 fields and out of them 300
is used and 200 is available. The component should refresh automatically
whenever any new entity (i.e any object, license, field, etc) is created or used.
